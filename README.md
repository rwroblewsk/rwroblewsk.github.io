## Public Projects

### Feedback Delay Network
A 4-delay line Feedback Delay Network implemented in C++. This project was originally implemented as the final lab project for the Stanford EE264 Digital Signal Processing class where it was integrated into a smartphone app. \

### Codec LB-75
A perceptual audio codec with additional block-switching and variable bitrate capabilities. This codec was developed as the final project for the Stanford MUSIC422 Perceptual Audio Coding class. In this class, a baseline perceptual audio codec was developed progressively. The final project involved adding additional components to the baseline implementation. The LB-75 codec was developed to improve the quality of transients through the addition of block-switching and a variable bitrate. \

### Tenor Ukulele Construction and Pickup Processing
Constructed a tenor ukulele with a piezo pickup. Filtered the piezo pickup output in a Python Jupyter Notebook to resemble a condenser microphone to improve sound quality. \

### Investigation on Even Harmonic Attenuation's Effect on Instrument Timbre Perception
Developed a short study to investigate the effect of even harmonic attenuation on instrument timbre perception across different instrument classes. This study was conducted as the final project for the Stanfored MUSIC251 Psychophysics and Music Cognition class. \
